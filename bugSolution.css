To avoid these issues, always ensure consistent unit usage within the `calc()` function. Avoid mixing unit-less values with values having units (such as px, em, rem, etc.).  If you need to combine different units, convert them to the same unit beforehand. For cross-context calculations, it's often better to calculate values separately and then assign them rather than relying on `calc()` to handle different contexts. For instance, use CSS variables or JavaScript to pre-calculate the values based on different contexts.
