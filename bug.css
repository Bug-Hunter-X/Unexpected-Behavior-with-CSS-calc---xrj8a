The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. For example, if you use a unit-less value (a number without a unit like `px` or `em`) along with a unit value, it can cause issues. Another problem arises when the calculation involves values from different contexts, such as values from different media queries or elements. This can lead to unexpected or inconsistent results.
