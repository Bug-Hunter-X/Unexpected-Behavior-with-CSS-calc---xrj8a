This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function:

1. **Mixing unit-less and unit values:** This can lead to unexpected results and inconsistent behavior across browsers.
2. **Cross-context calculations:** Performing calculations that involve values from different contexts (like different media queries or elements) can produce unexpected outputs. 

The `bug.css` file shows examples of these errors. The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected versions with explanations.
